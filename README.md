## Model Evaluation Summary
### Overview
- This section provides a summary of the evaluation of our `logistic regression` and `RandomForestClassifier` model's performance.

## `Evaluation Metrics`
```
- Accuracy: The accuracy of the model is 84.84%.
- Precision:
    - For class 0 (negative class): 86%
    - For class 1 (positive class): 52%
- Recall:
    - For class 0: 98%
    - For class 1: 14%
- F1-score:
    - Weighted average for class 0: 81%
    - Weighted average for class 1: 23%
```
## `Conclusions`
```
- The model performs well in identifying instances of class 0 (negative class) with high precision and recall.
- However, it struggles to correctly identify instances of class 1 (positive class), as indicated by the low recall for class 1.
- There is a trade-off between precision and recall, particularly for class 1.
- Further investigation into improving the model's performance on identifying positive instances may be necessary.
